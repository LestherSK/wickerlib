## Introduction

This project is based on the Explorer E202, with permission. 

Renato Romero put plans online for a Very Low Frequency (VLF) receiver capable between "a few Hz to beyond 10 kHz [which] makes it suitable to to receive radio signals of natural origin; signals not generated by human activity but by physical phenomena such as lightning and solar storms. Received signals are heard directly in your headset. The receiver amplifies the electric component of an electromagnetic signal."

His plans are <a href="http://www.vlf.it/romero2/explorer-e202.html">described here</a>. The Explorer E202 is no longer available for sale.

He gave me permission to work from his schematic to design a new layout and make my own units. I am releasing all of my documents and process under the CERN Open Hardware License v1.2.

## Version 1.1

For version 1.1, I was able to solder all the components, place the board in the metal box, apply a 9V battery for power, turn on the blue LED, and verify the basics of the operation. 

The volume knob, filter and power switches, and headphone jack all work correctly. I could hear the received sound in my headphones and it changed pitch and volume as I adjusted ground connections, turned the volume knob, and moved my hand around in the air over the box.

## Version 1.2

I created versions 1.0 and 1.1 in Eagle, but have converted to KiCad in v1.2. I ordered boards from OSH Park and should have them built up by next Friday, December 16, to verify the board. 

### Bill of Materials 

Total cost of parts is about $25 if you order minimums. It's about $100 if you go to the next price break for most at qty=10, which is what I did since I'm prototyping, and what I recommend if you want to build two or more units.
